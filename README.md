## Projects

• **[Fact Checker CLI](sonar-use-cases/fact_checker_cli/)** - A command-line tool that analyzes claims or articles for factual accuracy using Sonar API's search capabilities.

• **[Daily Knowledge Bot](sonar-use-cases/daily_knowledge_bot/)** - Python application that delivers interesting facts about rotating topics using the Perplexity AI API.

• **[Disease Information App](sonar-use-cases/daily_knowledge_bot/)** - Interactive browser-based application providing structured information about diseases using the Sonar API.

• **[FactCheck-X Chrome Extension](community-projects/factcheck-x/)** - A Chrome extension for AI-powered fact-checking of posts on X (Twitter) using the Perplexity API. Features one-click fact-checking with visual indicators (green for true, red for false, yellow for unclear), detailed explanations, source citations, caching to minimize API calls, and a history of past fact-checks. Includes both a Python FastAPI backend and Chrome extension frontend.
